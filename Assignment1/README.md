## Assignment 1
**Description/Purpose:** 

Two classes were created for this project in the Queue folder: Node and Queue. The Node class represents a single node in a queue, while the Queue class implements the functionality of a queue data structure.

The rules are defined in is `LadderGame.java`. This file creates the structure of how the game is played from start to finish using the given `dictionary.txt` file. The LadderGame class represents a game where players try to find a word ladder between two given words using the words from the dictionary file. 

One important component of the game is the WordInfo class. This class is responsible for tracking the previous moves and history of the words during the game. It helps in keeping track of the progress and allows for the identification of the word ladder solution.

In the `WordLadders.java` file, the game is ultimately played out with a total of 8 different ladders. Based on the given dictionary, only one ladder is not found, showcasing the effectiveness of the implemented algorithms and data structures.
