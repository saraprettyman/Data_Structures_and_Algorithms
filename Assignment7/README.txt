This is done to ensure that the flow of the network is conserved,
and that the residual graph (which is used to find augmenting paths) is properly updated.
 the residual graph would not accurately represent the remaining capacity
  of the edges in the network, since there would be edges that could
  potentially carry flow in the wrong direction.
